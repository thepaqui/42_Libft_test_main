# 42_Libft_test_main
This is my own test main for Libft (version 15, started on November 7th 2022).

Use at your own risk, this doesn't test everything and is meant to help for peer-to-peer corrections.

This doesn't test the bonuses. This isn't trying to emulate the Moulinette, there is no trace. This is mostly a visual help for personal testing.

I don't plan on updating this aymore, but feel free to take this code and customize it.



HOW TO USE:

Compile this main with your own libft.a and run your program.

Running the program without arguments will test everything.

Running it with one or more test codes as arguments will only test the functions associated with the codes.

To know the test codes, check out test_codes.txt.
