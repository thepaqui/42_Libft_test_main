# 42_Libft_test_main
This is my own test main for Libft (version 15, started on November 7th 2022).

Use at your own risk, this doesn't test everything and is meant to help for peer-to-peer corrections. This isn't trying to emulate the Moulinette, there is no trace. This is mostly a visual help for personal testing.

I don't plan on updating this after I validate this project, but feel free to take this code and customize it.



HOW TO USE:

Compile this main with your own libft.a and run ./a.out
Running ./a.out will test everything (bonus functions included)
Running it with a test code will only test the function associated with the code.
To know the codes, check out test_codes.txt
