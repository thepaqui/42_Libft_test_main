# 42_Libft_test_main
This is my own test main for Libft (version 15, November 9th 2022).

Use at your own risk, this doesn't test everything and is meant to help for peer-to-peer corrections. This isn't trying to emulate the Moulinette, there is no trace. This is mostly a visual help for personal testing.

I don't plan on updating this after I validate this project, but feel free to take this code and customize it.
